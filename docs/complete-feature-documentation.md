## 1. Introduction

VoyageurAI is a modern AI-powered travel planning application designed to help users create personalized trip itineraries. Built with React, TypeScript, and powered by Google's Gemini AI, the application offers a seamless experience for planning trips based on user preferences, interests, and travel style.

The application provides comprehensive trip planning features including day-by-day activity scheduling, curated travel highlights (attractions, hidden gems, restaurants, local foods), weather information, cost estimation, and the ability to save and share trips.

<a id="core-features"></a>
## 2. Core Features

<a id="ai-powered-trip-planning"></a>
### 2.1 AI-Powered Trip Planning

VoyageurAI's core functionality revolves around its AI-driven trip planning capability, powered by Google's Gemini AI model.

#### How it works:

1. **User Input Collection**: Users provide detailed information about their desired trip through the TripForm component, including:
   - Destination
   - Starting address
   - Travel dates
   - Budget level (budget, moderate, luxury)
   - Number of travelers
   - Interests (multiple selections from predefined categories)
   - Dietary restrictions
   - Accommodation preferences
   - Transportation preferences
   - Additional notes or special requirements

2. **AI Processing**: The application sends this structured data to the Gemini API with a carefully crafted prompt that instructs the AI to generate a comprehensive travel itinerary.

3. **Response Generation**: Gemini processes the input and generates a detailed, structured JSON response containing all the elements of a complete travel itinerary.

4. **Result Presentation**: The application processes the AI response and presents it to the user in an organized, user-friendly format using the ItineraryView component.

#### Technical Implementation:

The AI processing occurs in the `src/lib/gemini.ts` file, which contains the `generateItinerary` function. This function:

- Takes the user's trip form data as input
- Formats a detailed prompt with specific instructions for the AI
- Sends the request to the Gemini API with appropriate parameters
- Parses and validates the JSON response
- Returns a structured `GeneratedItinerary` object

The prompt is carefully engineered to ensure the AI generates comprehensive itineraries with:
- Detailed day-by-day schedules
- Must-visit attractions (at least 12-15)
- Hidden gems and local spots (at least 10-12)
- Recommended restaurants (at least 8)
- Local foods to try (at least 6)

Each response is structured according to the `GeneratedItinerary` interface defined in `src/types/index.ts`.

<a id="personalized-itineraries"></a>
### 2.2 Personalized Itineraries

VoyageurAI creates truly personalized itineraries by incorporating user preferences across multiple dimensions.

#### Personalization Factors:

1. **Destination Expertise**: The AI has knowledge about thousands of destinations worldwide and can create location-specific recommendations.

2. **Travel Style**: Different budget levels (budget, moderate, luxury) significantly alter the recommendations for accommodations, restaurants, and activities.

3. **Interest-Based Activities**: The selection of interests (adventure, culture, food, history, nature, shopping, etc.) directly influences which attractions and activities are prioritized in the itinerary.

4. **Dietary Considerations**: Food recommendations are adjusted based on dietary restrictions specified by the user.

5. **Travel Dates**: Seasonal considerations are taken into account when planning activities.

6. **Group Size**: The number of travelers influences recommendations for suitable venues and activities.

7. **Transportation Preferences**: Whether users prefer public transit, walking, driving, or other transportation methods affects the itinerary logistics.

8. **Accommodation Style**: Different accommodation preferences (hotel, hostel, resort, etc.) are incorporated into the planning.

#### Itinerary Components:

Each personalized itinerary includes:

1. **Summary**: A brief overview of the trip highlighting key aspects based on user preferences.

2. **Day-by-Day Schedule**: Detailed timeline for each day including:
   - Morning, afternoon, and evening activities
   - Meal recommendations
   - Transportation between locations
   - Approximate timing

3. **Travel Highlights**: Curated lists of:
   - Must-visit attractions
   - Hidden gems and local spots
   - Recommended restaurants
   - Local foods to try

4. **Practical Information**: Additional details relevant to the trip based on user preferences.

#### Implementation:

The personalization logic is primarily implemented in:
- The prompt engineering within `src/lib/gemini.ts`
- The filtering and organizing of AI responses
- The presentation components in `src/components/ItineraryView.tsx`
